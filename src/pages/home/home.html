            So that<br/> - We are more willing to take risk.<br/> - We are more willing to experiment, which requires failure.<br/> - We are more willing to explore, go somewhere where no one has gone before with the confidence that if we fail, if we
            tripple over, if we turn our backs, that those from our community, that those whom we trust and those who trust us will look after us, will pick up when we fall over ,<br/>will help us when we are hurt, our very survival depends on on it.<br/>
