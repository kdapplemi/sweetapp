            Rule1 - Go after the things you want
        </ion-card-header>

        <ion-card-content>
            You can go after whatwer you want but you cant deny anyone else whatever they want
            <br/>There are two ways to see the world,
            <br>1. some people see the things that they want
            <br/> 2. some people see the things that prevents them from getting the things they want
            <br/>

            Rule2 - Sometimes you are the problem.<br/> You get to take credit when you also take accountibility
        </ion-card-header>

        <ion-card-content>
            We have seen these althoug recently these people of finance who are smarter than rest of us until the thing collapse and they blamed everything else except themselfves<br/> Take accountability for your actions, you can take all the credit
            in the world for the things you do right as long as you also take responsibility for the things you do wrong<br/> It must be a balanced equation, you dont get it one way and not the other.<br/>

        <ion-card-header>
            Rule3 - Take care of each other
        </ion-card-header>

        <ion-card-content>
            All the guys that make it through when they find themelves physically spent,emotionally spent, when they have nothing left to give physically or emotionally somehow, someway they are able to find the energy to dig down deep inside themselves to find the
            enery to help the guy next to them.
            <br/>Its not about how tough you are, Its not about how fast you are, Its not about how fast you are
            <br>You better get really really good to help the guy next to you and the guy right of you, cause thats how people advance in world
            <br/>The world is too dangerous,the world is too difficult, for you to think that you can do these things alone.
            <br/>If you find your spark i commend you, now who you gonna ask for hel and when you gonna accept help when its offered
            <br/>Learn that skill, learn by practising helping each other. It will be the single most valueable thing you have ever learned in your entire life
            <br/> to accept help when its offered and to ask for it when you know you cant do it.
            <br/> The amazing thing is when you ask for help you will discover there are people all around you who always wahted to help you, they just did not think you needed it, because you kept pretending that you have everything in control.
            <br/> and the minute you say I dont know what I am doing, I am stuck,I am scared,I dont think I can do this, you will find that lots of people who love you rush in and take care of you.
            <br/>But that will only happen if you learn to take of them firt.

            Rule4 - Be the last to speak.
        </ion-card-header>

        <ion-card-content>
            The skill to hold your opinion to yourselves does two things,
            <br/>1. Its gives everybody the feeling that they have been heard, It gives every one the ablity that they have contributed
            <br>2. You get the benifit of hearing what everybody else has to think before you render your opinion.
            <br/>The skill is to keep you opinion to yourself
            <br/>If you agree with somebody dont nod yes
            <br/>If you dont agree with somebody dont nod no
            <br/>Simply sit there take it and the only thing you are allowed to do is ask questions so you can understand what they mean.

            As you gain fame, as you gain fortune, As you gain position in seniority, people will treat you better they will hold doors open for you they will get you a cup of tea or coffee without you even asking, they will call you sir and madam and the will give
            you stuff, none of that stuff is ment for you,that stuff is ment for the position you hold, for the level that you have achived of leader or sucess, or whatever you want to call it.
            <br/>Remember that lesson of humility and gratitude, you can accept all the free stuff, you can accept all the perks absolutely you can enjoy them, but just be greatful for them and know that none of it is ment for you but for the position
            you are holding.
            <br>None of us deserve the perks we get.

            So that<br/> - We are more willing to take risk.<br/> - We are more willing to experiment, which requires failure.<br/> - We are more willing to explore, go somewhere where no one has gone before with the confidence that if we fail, if we
            tripple over, if we turn our backs, that those from our community, that those whom we trust and those who trust us will look after us, will pick up when we fall over ,<br/>will help us when we are hurt, our very survival depends on on it.<br/>
